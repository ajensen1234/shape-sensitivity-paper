Because the motions of total knee implants have a direct influence on patient function and device longevity, it is important to understand how knee implants based on a variety of design philosophies perform in vivo. Fifty-nine knees in patients with 5 designs of implants were studied with fluoroscopic imaging during gait and stair-climbing activities. Many knees showed significantly different kinematics between the gait and stair activities, as well as differences from knees having other implant designs. The measured motions were consistent with the intrinsic constraint provided by the implant components and the variation in constraint over the flexion range.

Fixed-bearing TKA designs with asymmetric pivoting articulations are designed to provide more natural joint stability and kinematics. These designs have been used for more than 20 years and there is a substantial body of literature characterizing their performance. This article reviews the various design types of fixed-bearing pivoting TKA designs, and recounts their clinical, functional, and patient-preference performance from peer-reviewed studies. To date, the evidence suggests there is measurable benefit to providing closer-to-normal joint stability and kinematics, and that fixed-bearing, pivoting TKA designs may decrease instability-related revisions and improve patient satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Kinematics of total knee replacements (TKR) play an important role in assessing the success of a procedure and would be a valuable addition to clinical practice; however, measuring TKR kinematics is time consuming and labour intensive. Recently, an automatic single-plane fluoroscopic method utilizing machine learning has been developed to facilitate a quick and simple process for measuring TKR kinematics. This study aimed to validate the new automatic single-plane technique using biplanar radiostereometric analysis (RSA) as the gold standard. Twenty-four knees were imaged at various angles of flexion in a dedicated RSA lab and 113 image pairs were obtained. Only the lateral RSA images were used for the automatic single-plane technique to simulate single-plane fluoroscopy. Two networks helped automate the kinematics measurement process, one segmented implant components and the other generated an initial pose estimate for the optimization algorithm. Kinematics obtained via the automatic single plane and manual biplane techniques were compared using root-mean-square error and Bland{\textendash}Altman plots. Two observers measured the kinematics using the automated technique and results were compared with assess reproducibility. Root-mean-square errors were 0.8 mm for anterior{\textendash}posterior translation, 0.5 mm for superior{\textendash}inferior translation, 2.6 mm for medial{\textendash}lateral translation, 1.0{$^\circ$} for flexion{\textendash}extension, 1.2{$^\circ$} for abduction{\textendash}adduction, and 1.7{$^\circ$} for internal{\textendash}external rotation. Reproducibility, reported as root-mean-square errors between operator measurements, was submillimeter for in-plane translations and below 2{$^\circ$} for all rotations. Clinical Significance: The advantages of the automated single plane technique should aid in the kinematic measurement process and help researchers and clinicians perform TKR kinematic analyses.},

  abstract = {The current work introduces a system for fully automatic tracking of native glenohumeral kinematics in stereo-radiography sequences. The proposed method first applies convolutional neural networks to obtain segmentation and semantic key point predictions in biplanar radiograph frames. Preliminary bone pose estimates are computed by solving a non-convex optimization problem with semidefinite relaxations to register digitized bone landmarks to semantic key points. Initial poses are then refined by registering computed tomography-based digitally reconstructed radiographs to captured scenes, which are masked by segmentation maps to isolate the shoulder joint. A particular neural net architecture which exploits subject-specific geometry is also introduced to improve segmentation predictions and increase robustness of subsequent pose estimates. The method is evaluated by comparing predicted glenohumeral kinematics to manually tracked values from 17 trials capturing 4 dynamic activities. Median orientation differences between predicted and ground truth poses were 1.7◦ and 8.6◦ for the scapula and humerus, respectively. Joint-level kinematics differences were less than 2◦ in 65\%, 13\%, and 63\% of frames for XYZ orientation DoFs based on Euler angle decompositions. Automation of kinematic tracking can increase scalability of tracking workflows in research, clinical, or surgical applications.},

  abstract = {Wear of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene bearings in total knee replacements remains a major limitation to the longevity of these clinically successful devices. Few design tools are currently available to predict mild wear in implants based on varying kinematics, loads, and material properties. This paper reports the implementation of a computer modeling approach that uses fluoroscopically measured motions as inputs and predicts patient-specific implant damage using computationally efficient dynamic contact and tribological analyses. Multibody dynamic simulations of two activities (gait and stair) with two loading conditions (70{\textendash}30 and 50{\textendash}50 medial{\textendash}lateral load splits) were generated from fluoroscopic data to predict contact pressure and slip velocity time histories for individual elements on the tibial insert surface. These time histories were used in a computational wear analysis to predict the depth of damage due to wear and creep experienced by each element. Predicted damage areas, volumes, and maximum depths were evaluated against a tibial insert retrieved from the same patient who provided the in vivo motions. Overall, the predicted damage was in close agreement with damage observed on the retrieval. The gait and stair simulations separately predicted the correct location of maximum damage on the lateral side, whereas a combination of gait and stair was required to predict the correct location on the medial side. Predicted maximum damage depths were consistent with the retrieval as well. Total computation time for each damage prediction was less than 30 min. Continuing refinement of this approach will provide a robust tool for accurately predicting clinically relevant wear in total knee replacements.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning enable autonomous measurement of total knee arthroplasty kinematics through single-plane fluoroscopy. However, symmetric implants present challenges in optimization routines, causing ``symmetry traps'' and ambiguous poses. Achieving clinically robust kinematics measurement requires addressing this issue. We devised an algorithm that converts a ``true'' pose to its corresponding ``symmetry trap'' orientation. From a dataset of nearly 13,000 human supervised kinematics, this algorithm constructs an augmented dataset of ``true'' and ``symmetry trap'' kinematics, used to train eight classification machine learning algorithms. The outputs from the highest-performing algorithm classify kinematics sequences as 'obviously true' or 'potentially ambiguous.' We construct a spline through 'obviously true' poses, and 'ambiguous' poses are compared to the spline to determine correct orientation. The machine learning algorithms achieved 88-94\% accuracy on our internal test set and 91-93\% on our external test set. Applying our spline algorithm to kinematics sequences yielded 91.1\% accuracy, 94\% specificity, but 67\% sensitivity. The accuracy of standard ML algorithms for implants within 5 degrees of a pure-lateral view was 71\%, rising to 88\% beyond 5 degrees. This pioneering study systematizes addressing model-image registration issues with symmetric tibial implants. High accuracy suggests potential use of ML algorithms to mitigate shape-ambiguity errors in pose measurements from single-plane fluoroscopy. Our results also suggest an imaging protocol for measuring kinematics that favors more oblique viewing angles, which could further disambiguate ``true'' and ``symmetry trap'' poses.},

However, current methods of measuring TKA kinematics are too cumbersome, inaccurate, or timeconsuming for practical clinical application. Even state-of-the-art techniques require human-supervision to obtain clinically reliable kinematics. Eliminating human supervision could potentially make this technology practical for clinical use. Methods: We demonstrate a fully autonomous pipeline for quantifying 3D-TKA kinematics from singleplane radiographic imaging. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) segmented the femoral and tibial implants from the image. Second, those segmented images were compared to precomputed shape libraries for initial pose estimates. Lastly, a numerical optimization routine aligned 3D implant contours and fluoroscopic images to obtain the final implant poses. Results: The autonomous technique reliably produces kinematic measurements comparable to humansupervised measures, with root-mean-squared differences of less than 0.7 mm and 4  for our test data, and 0.8 mm and 1.7  for external validation studies. Conclusion: A fully autonomous method to measure 3D-TKA kinematics from single-plane radiographic images produces results equivalent to a human-supervised method, and may soon make it practical to perform these measurements in a clinical setting.},

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for finding the global minimum of a multivariate function subject to simple bounds. The algorithm is a modification of the standard Lipschitzian approach that eliminates the need to specify a Lipschitz constant. This is done by carrying out simultaneous searches using all possible constants from zero to infinity. On nine standard test functions, the new algorithm converges in fewer function evaluations than most competing methods. The motivation for the new algorithm stems from a different way of looking at the Lipschitz constant. In particular, the Lipschitz constant is viewed as a weighting parameter that indicates how much emphasis to place on global versus local search. In standard Lipschitzian methods, this constant is usually large because it must equal or exceed the maximum rate of change of the objective function. As a result, these methods place a high emphasis on global search and exhibit slow convergence. In contrast, the new algorithm carries out simultaneous searches using all possible constants, and therefore operates at both the global and local level. Once the global part of the algorithm finds the basin of convergence of the optimum, the local part of the algorithm quickly and automatically exploits it. This accounts for the fast convergence of the new algorithm on the test functions.},

A phase correction scheme is employed to produce the aligned phase so that the IARTD is invariant to rotation. The distance between two IARTDs is defined by combining differences in the magnitudes and aligned phases. In an experiment using the MPEG-7 shape dataset, the proposed method outperforms existing methods; the average BEP of the proposed method is 57.69\%, while the average BEPs of the invariant Zernike moments descriptor and the traditional ART are 41.64\% and 36.51\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {A method was developed for registering three-dimensional knee implant models to single plane X-ray fluoroscopy images. We use a direct image-to-image similarity measure, taking advantage of the speed of modern computer graphics workstations to quickly render simulated (predicted) images. As a result, the method does not require an accurate segmentation of the implant silhouette in the image (which can be prone to errors). A robust optimization algorithm (simulated annealing) is used that can escape local minima and find the global minimum (true solution). Although we focus on the analysis of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in this paper, the method can be (and has been) applied to other implanted joints, including, but not limited to, hips, ankles, and temporomandibular joints. Convergence tests on an in vivo image show that the registration method can reliably find poses that are very close to the optimal (i.e., within 0.4 and 0.1 mm), even from starting poses with large initial errors. However, the precision of translation measurement in the (out-of-plane) direction is not as good. We also show that the method is robust with respect to image noise and occlusions. However, a small amount of user supervision and intervention is necessary to detect cases when the optimization algorithm falls into a local minimum. Intervention is required less than 5\% of the time when the initial starting pose is reasonably close to the correct answer, but up to 50\% of the time when the initial starting pose is far away. Finally, extensive evaluations were performed on cadaver images to determine accuracy of relative pose measurement. Comparing against data derived from an optical sensor as a ``gold standard,'' the overall rootmean-square error of the registration method was approximately 1.5 and 0.65 mm (although translation error was higher). However, uncertainty in the optical sensor data may account for a large part of the observed error.},

  abstract = {Recent improvements in Fourier descriptor (FD) shape analysis enable rapid identification of three-dimensional objects using FD feature vectors derived from their boundaries. In three-dimensional shape analysis, it is essential to preserve all information to achieve good performance. In the real-time situation it is, of course, equally impor\- tant to use a computationally efficient method. Our method of threedimensional shape analysis using normalized Fourier descriptors is in\- formation preserving, yet is as fast as previous suboptimum methods. In addition, our feature vector has a linear property, allowing us to interpolate between library projections and effectively define a con\- tinuum of library projections rather than a finite set. This method is applied to the analysis of sequential data varying in resolution and orientation relative to the camera. Computational considerations are discussed, and it is seen that real-time implementation of the method is feasible.},

  abstract = {More and more images have been generated in digital form around the world. There is a growing interest in 1nding images in large collections or from remote databases. In order to 1nd an image, the image has to be described or represented by certain features. Shape is an important visual feature of an image. Searching for images using shape features has attracted much attention. There are many shape representation anddescription techniques in the literature. In this paper, we classify and review these important techniques. We examine implementation procedures for each technique and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. Some recent research results are also included and discussed in this paper. Finally, we identify some promising techniques for image retrieval according to standard principles.},

  abstract = {A better knowledge of the kinematics behavior of total knee replacement (TKR) during activity still remains a crucial issue to validate innovative prosthesis designs and different surgical strategies. Tools for more accurate measurement of in vivo kinematics of knee prosthesis components are therefore fundamental to improve the clinical outcome of knee replacement. In the present study, a novel model-based method for the estimation of the three-dimensional (3-D) position and orientation (pose) of both the femoral and tibial knee prosthesis components during activity is presented. The knowledge of the 3-D geometry of the components and a single plane projection view in a fluoroscopic image are sufficient to reconstruct the absolute and relative pose of the components in space. The technique is based on the best alignment of the component designs with the corresponding projection on the image plane. The image generation process is modeled and an iterative procedure localizes the spatial pose of the object by minimizing the Euclidean distance of the projection rays from the object surface. Computer simulation and static/dynamic in vitro tests using real knee prosthesis show that the accuracy with which relative orientation and position of the components can be estimated is better than 1.5  and 1.5 mm, respectively. In vivo tests demonstrate that the method is well suited for kinematics analysis on TKR patients and that good quality images can be obtained with a carefully positioning of the fluoroscope and an appropriate dosage. With respect to previously adopted template matching techniques, the present method overcomes the complete segmentation of the components on the projected image and also features the simultaneous evaluation of all the six degrees of freedom (DOF) of the object. The expected small difference between successive poses in in vivo sequences strongly reduces the frequency of false poses and both the operator and computation time.},
