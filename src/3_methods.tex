\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data Collection}
For shape sensitivity analysis, representative 3D models of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) humeral and glenosphere implants, as well as total knee arthroplasty (TKA) femoral and tibial implants, were obtained from a manufacturer.
The study focused on a single size for each implant type, as the scale of the shapes was normalized using an Invariant Shape Descriptor, rendering multiple sizes unnecessary for this analysis.
\subsection{Image Generation}
Each implant's binary silhouette was rendered to a $1024\times 1024$ image plane using an in-house CUDA camera model (CUDA Version 12.1) \cite{nickollsScalableParallelProgramming2008}.
The model featured a 1000mm focal length and 0.3mm per pixel resolution.
All programming tasks utilized an NVIDIA Quadro P2200 GPU.
\subsection{Invariant Angular Radial Transform}
The Invariant Angular Radial Transform Descriptor (IARTD) was selected for its radial direction sensitivity, enabling the detection of subtle contour changes in projected shapes \cite{leeNewShapeDescription2012}.
This sensitivity allows us to address minor changes along the contour of the projected shape, which is a desirable property for determining the minor changes in shape with respect to input orientation.

IARTD computation involves aggregating orthogonal basis components across the unit polar disk, forming a complex moment.
Each basis function has an order ($n$) and a repetition ($p$).
The order can be visualized as concentric rings on the polar disk, and the repetition as the count of slices partitioning the unit disk along $\theta$.
For these calculations, the image is normalized so that the center is at $(0,0)$, and the four corners are at $(\pm1,\pm1)$.

Each angular radial transform (ART) coefficient is a complex double integral (\cref{eq:F_np}) over the image in polar coordinates, $f(\rho,\theta)$ multiplied by the ART basis function, $V_{np}(\rho,\theta)$ (\cref{eq:V_np}).

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:F_np}
	F_{np} = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{1}f(\rho,\theta)V_{np}(\rho,\theta)\rho d\rho d\theta
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:V_np}
	V_{np}(\rho,\theta) = A_{p}(\theta)R_{n}(\rho)
\end{equation}

The radial basis function includes a complex exponential, $A_{p}(\theta)$ (\cref{eq:A_p}), ensuring rotational invariance, and a trigonometric transform, $R_{p}(\theta)$ (\cref{eq:R_n}), to establish orthogonality.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:A_p}
	A_{p}(\theta) = \dfrac{1}{2\pi}e^{jp\theta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:R_n}
	R_{n}(\rho) =
	\begin{cases}
		1                   & n=0     \\
		2 \cos (\pi n \rho) & n \ne 0
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Phase correction is applied to each ART coefficient (\cref{eq:art_phase_correction}, \cref{eq:fnp_phase_correction}) to adjust for differences in in-plane rotation.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:art_phase_correction}
	\phi'_{np} = \phi_{np} - \phi_{n,1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:fnp_phase_correction}
	F_{np}' = F_{np}e^{-jp\phi_{n,1}}
\end{equation}

Subsequently, the final feature vector is formulated by the polar decomposition of each coefficient at every order and repetition (\cref{eq:iartd}).
Values from the first two repetitions are excluded, as they do not provide significant information \cite{leeNewShapeDescription2012}.
The complete IARTD feature vector encompasses values of $n={0, \dots, 3 }$ and $p={0, \dots, 8}$ per the original authors' suggestion \cite{leeNewShapeDescription2012}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:iartd}
	IARTD = \{|F'_{np}|, \phi_{np}'\} \text{ where } n \ge 0, p \ge 2
\end{equation}

\subsection{Shape Differences and Sensitivity}
In order to quantify the overall change between shapes, a readily interpretable value must be established.
To simplify notation, successive rotations are denoted as subscripts, with $R_{z}R_{x}R_{y}$ being represented as $R_{z,x,y}$.
If more than 3 rotations are applied successively, the full rotation sequence will be captured as $R_{r_{1},r_{2},r_{3},\cdots,r_{n}}$.
Similarly, the application of the IARTD equation to an implant at a specific input orientation $R_{z,x,y}$ is denoted as $IARTD(R_{z,x,y})$.
Shape differences were calculated using the central difference equation on the IARTD vector produced from two different orientations.
The grid of sampled orientations had extrema of $\pm 30^{\circ}$ with a step size of $5^{\circ}$ for each of the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes.
The ``differences'' along each axis were computed using a positive and negative rotation ($\pm \delta $) of 1 degree.
Therefore, for every set of $x,y,z$ rotations, three distinct shape differences are computed, one each for $\delta_{x}$, $\delta_{y}$, and $\delta_{z}$ (\cref{eq:shape-derivative}).

For notational brevity, we will condense the total equation to a single $\Delta S(\delta)$, (representing $\Delta Shape$ for a differential rotation $\delta$).

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:shape-derivative}
	\begin{split}
		\Delta S(\delta)_{z,x,y}  \equiv & IARTD(R_{z,x,y,+\delta})                        \\
		                                 & - IARTD(R_{z,x,y,-\delta})                      \\
		\forall                          & \delta \in \{\delta_{x},\delta_{y},\delta_{z}\}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{mdframed}
  \textcolor{red}{Is this approximation averaged over separate unit
perturbations in each DoF(1), or is each axis tweaked
simultaneously so there are only two IARTDs to diff (2)? \\
This is the (1) option.
I tried to emphasize this further in the above section by describing $>3$ rotations using a successive notation. I also tried to emphasize that this was for each $\delta_{x,y,z}$ in the equation itself.
}
\end{mdframed}

The disparate scales of IARTD vector elements necessitate their standardization, ensuring a balanced assessment of global behavior without overemphasis on any individual element.
Z-scaling provides a practical approach to standardizing each element relative to its distribution.
After z-scaling, the Euclidean norm of each $S(\delta)_{z,x,y}$ is calculated to quantify the total shape change for a specific differential rotation (\cref{eq:euc_norm}).

The final step takes advantage of two factors: first, that the in-plane rotations are the first in the Euler sequence ($z$-axis), and second, that this type of rotation does not affect the in-plane shape.
For each $x$ and $y$ input rotation, an average is computed from values where $x$ and $y$ remain constant while $z$ varies (\cref{eq:z_rot_norm}). The final values are obtained from this equation, denoted by $\mathbb{S}$.
Individual plots will be created for $\mathbb{S}_{x,y}$, corresponding to each differential rotation in $x$, $y$, and $z$, and for each of the four implant types.
An analysis of these plots will be conducted to assess the performance of JTML optimization and to explore areas where optimization faces significant challenges.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:euc_norm}
	\|S(\delta)_{z,x,y}\|_{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:z_rot_norm}
	\mathbb{S}(\delta)_{x,y} = \dfrac{\sum_{z} \| S(\delta)_{z,x,y} \|_{2}}{N}
\end{equation}
