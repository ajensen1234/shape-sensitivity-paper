\begin{abstract}
	Recent methods in computer vision and machine learning have enabled fully-autonomous kinematics measurement for Total Knee Arthroplasty implant components.
	Unfortunately, this same performance does not translate to reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty implants.
	This study explores relating 3D implant orientation to 2D projection sensitivity using the Invariant Angular Radial Transform Descriptor (IARTD).
	Minor rotational differences yielded negligible shape changes along near-symmetric dimensions like humeral internal-external rotation and tibial internal/external axis.
	Furthermore, axes problematic for registration correlated with lower descriptor sensitivity.
	Overall, symmetrical geometries and orientations intrinsically limit extractable silhouette information. However, incorporating bony anatomical landmarks as optimization constraints shows promise for overcoming ambiguity and registration difficulties.
